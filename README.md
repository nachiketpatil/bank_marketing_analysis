# bank_marketing_analysis
This is practical assignment 3 to analyse performance of different ML models on bank direct marketing data

## Problem Statement
The goal of this exercise is to evaluate performance and accuracy of different Classification models in ML on the given Bank Direct Marketing Dataset. Provide actionable feedback based on the analysis.

## Data Description
The dataset is taken from the UCI Machine Learning repository [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing).  It comes from from a Portugese banking institution and is a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns. It contains client attributes like age, job, marital status, etc, there are some attributes of when was the client last contacted. Other socio-economic attributes are also included and finally the result of the marketing contact - whether the client accepted the offer of long term deposit or not.

The dataset is in the `/data` subfolder, file name `bank-additional-full.csv`.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- `matplotlib.pyplot` (for plotting)
- `seaborn` (for enhanced visualizations)
- `pandas` (for data manipulation)
- `numpy` (for numerical operations)

To run the code either use [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) or upload the notebook and directories to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).


Local setup:
```bash
 pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas numpy
 pip install notebook
```
