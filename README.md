# bank_marketing_analysis
This is practical assignment 3 to analyse performance of different ML models on bank direct marketing data

## Problem Statement

The commands and code to manipulate and visualize the data is provided in and Interactive Python Notebook (Jupyter Notebook) in the repository.

## Data Description
The dataset contains :
### 1. User Attributes

### 2. Contextual Attributes

### 3. Coupon Attributes


### Acceptance of coupon Y:  

The dataset is in the `/data` subfolder.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- `matplotlib.pyplot` (for plotting)
- `seaborn` (for enhanced visualizations)
- `pandas` (for data manipulation)
- `numpy` (for numerical operations)

To run the code either use [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) or upload the notebook and directories to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).


Local setup:
```bash
 pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas numpy
 pip install notebook
```
